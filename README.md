# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualiser
This project is an interactive web application designed to assist the understanding of various sorting algorithms. It offers users a hands-on experience in observing how different sorting methods, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more, rearrange data elements. Application displays data graphically, with bars representing each element. As the sorting process unfolds, users witness the step-by-step animation, allowing for a real-time visualization of sorting techniques.This project includes adjustable animation speeds, algorithm selection options, random data generation, and informative step-by-step explanations using bars as data, making it an invaluable educational tool.
